However, the implementation is difficult for different reasons. Objectives: To evaluate the daily use of the EBN, the attitude towards EBN and the skills and knowledge of nurses to apply EBN in the selected health centers and also, to explore the self-perceived factors that may hinder the implementation of EBN at work and the possible measures to improve it by the nurses that work in PC. Methods: Cross-sectional, descriptive, multicenter and mixed concurrent triangulation strategy research, compose of a validated questionnaire and two open questions. Results: 65 nurses participated, mostly women, of whom 50,8% have received EBN’s formation. The punctuation of the different parts of the questionnaire are: 27,02 (x̄) in the EBN’s daily use, 18 (m) in the attitude and 44,15 (x̄) in the EBN’s skills and knowledge. Some factors self-perceived that difficult the EBN’s implementation are the lack of formation and time and the job insecurity and there are some measures suggested for palliate it such as: formation, recruitment and teamwork. Conclusions: The participants show a favorable attitude towards EBN, but daily use and skills and knowledge are moderate, observing a relationship between training in EBN and nursing specialization with greater skills and knowledge in EBN. There is a need to carry out studies with a greater impact for a more complete evaluation and implementation of the appropriate strategies. © COPYRIGHT Servicio de Publicaciones - Universidad de Murcia","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85193025164"

In the context of gender identity (GI) regulations, the adaptation of identification protocols is required for compliant implementation. Objective: to identify challenges and tensions in patient identification as a safety goal and its intersection with the current gender identity legislation in Argentina. Methods: a qualitative approach was used to collect data from seven healthcare institutions with patient admissions, selected based on their different profiles in terms of sector (public/private), patient safety accreditation process, and type of care (specialized/general). Grounded theory was employed to identify common institutional patterns. Results: three institutional situations were identified: 1. Contradiction: where compliance with GI regulations is perceived to undermine secure patient identification; 2. Potential convergence: although GI regulations are not fully implemented in patient identification, institutions deploy informal strategies to comply with them; 3. Convergence: institutions that have made changes to records and systems in line with GI. All institutions acknowledge the need for training in the care of transgender, transvestite, and non-binary patients. Conclusions: strengthening institutional policies based on safety goals and adherence to gender identity legislation is necessary. Organizational changes are essential, and training is needed to address the care of transgender, transvestite, and non-binary patients effectively. © 2024; Los autores.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186436088"

Method: Hermeneutical phenomenological study. Sixteen in-depth interviews were carried out with nursing students from a public university in the city of Medellin, during the years 2021 and 2022. Narrative was used, which allowed a greater approach to people as social individuals and the understanding of the way in which they construct their personal and cultural realities. Results: Four thematic categories emerged: Changes and transformations of the student, meaning of self-care, aspects that have not yet been incorporated, and practices that have been incorporated. Conclusions: The narratives of the participants about what those first years of encounter with university life mean and the process lived throughout it, allow understanding the paths taken from their perspectives and contexts, as well as understanding of the efforts and struggles from its limitations. Transcending this understanding, and from the Foucaultian paradigm, it is also important to hope, as some of them have done, that they learn to know and recognize-themselves, their desires, capacities, strengths, resources and limitations, as well as to learn how to overcome and transform the various moments into a continuous process of introspection and reflection by making self-care an attitude of life and transcending the knowledge they have learned in their university education when they care for others. © 2023, Universidad de Caldas.

Nurses, in their role as educators, must carry out actions to prevent the disease. It is interesting to learn about their experiences in the care of renal patients in primary health care, as this is where the progression of the disease is prevented. Objective: To describe the experience of nursing professionals in primary health care in the care of patients with chronic kidney disease.Materials and Method: Qualitative study, with a sample of 10 nurses working in different primary health care centres in Copiapó (Chile). A semi-structured interview and data analysis were conducted using open coding in the Atlas Ti program. Results: Four categories emerged: factors related to quality of care, nursing care management, multidisciplinary care, and conditioning elements for nursing care. Significant limitations for the care of the renal patient were evidenced: lack of time and specific consultations for follow-up, limited professional training in the subject, and socio-economic factors of the patient that influence care. Conclusions: Including specific care for renal patients in primary care and training nurses are essential tools for improving the care of patients with advanced chronic kidney disease. © 2024, Sociedad Espanola de Enfermeria Nefrologica.

The causes, inadequate food intake in quantity and quality required to meet the needs of the body during growth and psychomotor development, childhood malnutrition, which affects children under 5 years of age worldwide, associated with social and economic determinants in the most countries in the region. In Ecuador it affects 27,2 % of children under 2 years of age, this is the result of inadequate or insufficient nutrition. Objectives: determine the number of infants who are suffering from child malnutrition under 3 to 5 years of age E.G.B. Republic of Colombia, from the Saquisilí canton. Methods: a cross-sectional, quantitative design study with descriptive scope was carried out. Three instruments were used, the first instrument was the WHO growth curve, structured by percentiles, the second was the survey directed at parents, and the third instrument was a questionnaire to assess development-learning. Results: the results obtained in this research describe that 90 % exclusively maintained breast milk during the first six months of life, being a protective factor for the children’s immune system. In the final results obtained from the research, mild malnutrition is reflected. In 36,7 % of children, and a significant 20 % of these children suffer from moderate malnutrition, which can indirectly affect their learning development. Conclusions: in this sense, child malnutrition can be reduced by improving levels of maternal education and government policies to promote income redistribution, since the highest percentage of malnourished children belongs to the lowest poverty quintile. © 2024; Los autores.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85187886328"

Development: The experience of the nursing staff of multiple sclerosis units and monographic consultations, in 8 Spanish hospitals, is collected from the beginning of the pandemic and in later stages, and the adaptations that they made to continue caring for patients are specifically described. The scientific literature about how the SARS-CoV-2 has affected patients with multiple sclerosis is also reviewed, as well as the experiences of other multiple sclerosis teams in health centres in other countries. Conclusions: During the lockdown and in later stages, new forms and previously little used forms of care were applied to multiple sclerosis patients. The nursing staff kept contact with them by telephone and online, provided them with information about safety and behaviour in relation to COVID-19. Face-to-face visits, treatments and distribution of medication were adapted. Information was provided about how patients could receive psychosocial support and about how they could maintain their quality of life. © 2022 Sociedad Española de Enfermería Neurológica","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85134331866"

METHODOLOGY: Cross-sectional quantitative descriptive study. Assistance nurses and the mental health screening they applied in Family Health Centers of the Metropolitan Region of the community of Macul commune during 2020 were investigated. The variables measured were derived from survey applications such as: AUDIT, MiniMental, Yesavage, Zarit, abbreviated Zarit and CRAFFT; Consultation modality: in-person and telemedicine; and sociodemographic characteristics: sex such as gender, years age, and place of work. RESULTS: Of the total application of guidelines, 78.72% corresponds to in-person care and 21.27% to telemedicine. There is an important feminization of nurses, 84.78% of nurses are females. 54.35% of nurses have low work experience (0-5 years). Highly experienced professionals (>13 years) stand out in the average number of guidelines applied, with 93.64 per year. Most surveys with altered results were found in telemedicine consultations. CONCLUSIONS: The evolution of telemedicine, Primary Health Care, and Nursing is essential to face the needs of the population, especially regarding mental health. This study shows a lack of protocolization of protocols related to Telemedicine consultations, which may result in less screening of mental health problems. This investigation can lay the groundwork to start a process of improvement of telemedicine and telenursing in Chile. © 2024, Dayann Martínez Santana.

Worldwide, human beings currently tend to live longer than ever before, as exemplified by the recent trend that most people have a life expectancy equal to or greater than 60 years. It is essential to understand that a large number of older adults at some point in their lives will need a caregiver, and possibly institutionalization. OBJECTIVE. To demonstrate the importance of comprehensive nursing care in institutionalized older adults. DEVELOPMENT. Aging within a nursing home involves physical, social and psychoemotional modifications. Health may have deteriorated, and it is likely that some friendships or relatives have been lost. In some cases, the surviving spouse may find spirituality to be of great help, since it is frequently related to transcendence. It is also important that in homes for the elderly there is a place provided for recreation, where the exchange of ideas or experiences among older adults is encouraged, contributing to the physical and mental well-being of the residents. Comprehensive care of the elderly resident in a nursing home requires great competence and represents important challenges for the nursing staff. In addition to the care that the elderly demand, it is therefore necessary to be trained to understand the phenomenon of aging in this context. CONCLUSION. Comprehensive care of the older adult in the nursing home can be useful to increase well-being and quality of life. © 2024, Dayann Martínez Santana.
